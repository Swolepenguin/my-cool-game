PONG SWITCHAROO
 

             BACKROUND
This game was my first project with General assembly it was a test to see how id put the material that we had been learning for the first few weeks together and make something that not only works but is fun and creative. My motivation for creating pong switcharoo would have to be playing this really old pong game one of my older cousins had when i was younger, nowadays games have advanced so much and have a lot of different aspects and the ability to do many things thanks to the increase in technology of the time we live which is what i grew up with but he grew up with pong and even in its simplicty it was able to bring me alot of joy so i wanted to create that but with my own little twist.
